Todo-app

Overview
The Todo-app is a simple yet powerful application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Developed using modern web technologies, this app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, marking them as completed as they go.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for handling the view layer.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds types, used to ensure more robust code and reduce errors.
SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that adds additional features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, used for writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS styles.
BEM Methodology: A naming convention that makes CSS styles easier to read and understand, enhancing the scalability and reusability of the styles.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
Edit Tasks: Each task can be edited after being created.
Delete Tasks: Unwanted tasks can be removed from the list.
Complete Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed, visually crossing them off the list.
